# NOTES

## Todo

* Update allowed file types for URI

**Audio**
```txt
MP3: MPEG-1 audio layer 3

AAC: MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding

ALAC: Apple Lossless

HE-AAC: MPEG-4 High Efficiency AAC
```

## Solutions

* To prevent further issues with string-matching validation methods, jst convert match result to strict boolean in cases where match first match-group does not need to match the input explicitly.
